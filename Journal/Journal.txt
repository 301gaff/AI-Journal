Week 1:
This week I used AI mainly for debugging and I used my previous work from another class to look at and see what put down for a simmilar question to see if I can answer 
the question without using AI to answer it for me. I tried out Claude AI for the first time and wanted to try and see how it  differs from ChatGPT to see if the results can be 
different or simmilar in any capacity. From what I found is that the results usually were the same if you just copied and pasted the question in there and nothing else. Even though 
it does practially give you the same answer Claude does try to explain the code and results in greater detail rather ChatGPT just gives a short description of both 
the code and the results.
