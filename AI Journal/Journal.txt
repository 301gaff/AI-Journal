Week 1:
This week I used AI mainly for debugging and I used my previous work from another class to look at and see what put down for a simmilar question to see if I can answer 
the question without using AI to answer it for me. I tried out Claude AI for the first time and wanted to try and see how it  differs from ChatGPT to see if the results can be 
different or simmilar in any capacity. From what I found is that the results usually were the same if you just copied and pasted the question in there and nothing else. Even though 
it does practially give you the same answer Claude does try to explain the code and results in greater detail rather ChatGPT just gives a short description of both 
the code and the results.

Week 2: 
This week I didnâ€™t use AI to complete the assignment itself, but I thought about
how it could be useful for creating practice questions that explain concepts 
with small examples. Since our focus was on conditionals, loops, and lists, 
I could have asked AI to give me prompts like these:

- Describe how a while loop is different from a for loop, 
with an example that runs until a counter reaches 5.

- Show how to combine a loop and a conditional, 
with an example that prints only the even numbers from [2, 3, 5, 8, 10].

Using AI this way would help me think about the concepts more clearly and 
give me extra practice problems, but I made sure to work through the actual 
assignment on my own.
