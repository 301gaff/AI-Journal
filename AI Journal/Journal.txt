Week 2: 
This week I didnâ€™t use AI to complete the assignment itself, but I thought about
how it could be useful for creating practice questions that explain concepts 
with small examples. Since our focus was on conditionals, loops, and lists, 
I could have asked AI to give me prompts like these:

- Describe how a while loop is different from a for loop, 
with an example that runs until a counter reaches 5.

- Show how to combine a loop and a conditional, 
with an example that prints only the even numbers from [2, 3, 5, 8, 10].

Using AI this way would help me think about the concepts more clearly and 
give me extra practice problems, but I made sure to work through the actual 
assignment on my own.
